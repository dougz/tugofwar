  This was a "scrum" puzzle&mdash;a puzzle meant to be solved by many teammates
  looking at their computers at the same time.
  The game showed each player a pair of choices with voting buttons.
  And there was a deadline clock.
  Once enough players had voted, the winning choice became the team choice.
  For this after-the-hunt version, we'll let you make all the choices on your own.
